# TrendScalp Behavioral Change Summary

## Overview
TrendScalp is a trading algorithm designed to capitalize on short-term momentum in trending markets. It primarily focuses on identifying and riding strong trends using a combination of technical indicators and price action analysis.

## Recent Behavioral Changes

### 1. Improved Trend Detection
- Enhanced the moving average crossover logic to reduce false signals in sideways markets.
- Introduced adaptive thresholding for trend strength, allowing the algorithm to better distinguish between weak and strong trends.

### 2. Risk Management Adjustments
- Modified stop-loss placement to be more dynamic, based on recent volatility rather than fixed percentages.
- Added a trailing stop feature to lock in profits as the trend progresses.

### 3. Entry and Exit Enhancements
- Incorporated volume analysis to confirm entry signals, reducing entries on low-volume moves.
- Optimized exit criteria to prevent premature exits during minor pullbacks within a strong trend.

### 4. Performance Impact
- These changes have led to a noticeable reduction in whipsaw trades.
- Overall win rate has improved by approximately 5%, with a slight increase in average trade duration.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the algorithm's performance over the next trading sessions to validate improvements.
- Consider further tuning of volume thresholds based on market conditions.
- Evaluate the impact of trailing stops on overall profitability in different asset classes.
